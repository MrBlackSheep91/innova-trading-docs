## Overview

InnovaTrading connects to your MetaTrader 4 or MetaTrader 5 terminal through an **Expert Advisor (EA)**. Once connected, you get:

- **Real-time market data** from your broker
- **Account information** (balance, equity, margin)
- **Trade history** synced automatically
- **Position tracking** updated every second
- **Multi-account support** - connect as many accounts as you want

## How It Works

    A[MT4/MT5 Terminal] -->|EA sends data| B[Innova Cloud]
    B -->|Displays| C[InnovaTrading Platform]
    C -->|Charts & Analytics| D[Your Browser]
```

1. **You install** the InnovaTrading EA on your MetaTrader terminal
2. **EA connects** to Innova Cloud using your personal API token
3. **Data flows** securely to your InnovaTrading dashboard
4. **You analyze** with our advanced charting tools

<Note>
  Your trading credentials never leave your terminal. The EA only reads and sends market data - it does NOT execute trades.
</Note>

## Requirements

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="MetaTrader 4 or 5">
    Any MT4 or MT5 terminal from any broker works. The EA is compatible with:
    - Desktop terminals (Windows)
    - VPS installations
    - Multiple instances on the same machine
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Internet Connection">
    The EA needs to reach `cloud.innova-trading.com` on port 443 (HTTPS). Most brokers allow this by default.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="WebRequest Permission">
    MetaTrader must allow WebRequest to our server URL. We'll show you how to configure this in the [installation guide](/guides/install-ea).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Security

<Info>
  **Your data is secure.** All communication uses HTTPS encryption. Your broker login credentials are never transmitted - only market data.
</Info>

| Data Sent | Data NOT Sent |
|-----------|---------------|
| Symbol prices | Broker password |
| Account balance/equity | Personal information |
| Open positions | Trading permissions |
| Trade history | Two-factor codes |

Each API token is:
- **Unique** to your account
- **Locked** to the first MT4/MT5 account that uses it
- **Revocable** at any time from your dashboard
- **Expiring** after 1 year (renewable)
